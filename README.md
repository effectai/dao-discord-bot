#### Cycle
- `!cycle` Show cycle details such as what the current cycle is, when the cycle started, how long it takes until it ends and when the voting duration ends.

#### Reminders
There are a couple of reminders that the bot runs:
- `dao_call_notify` is a **cron** notifier which runs every wednesday 5 PM (UTC +02:00) because of the weekly DAO call.
- `dao_vote_notify` is a **date** notifier which runs on a specific date, for this notifier it runs on the date 1 day prior before that the vote_duration ends.
- `dao_new_cycle_notify` is an **interval** notifier which runs after an amount of time. Now it runs after 1 hour, repeatedly.
- `dao_new_proposals_notify` is an **interval** is an **interval** notifier which runs after an amount of time. Now it runs after 1 hour, repeatedly.

With the following command you can reschedule the time of a notifier:
- `!reschedule <trigger> <job_id> <args>`

Based on the `trigger`, you will have to pass different arguments (`args`).

- `cron`
- `date`
- `interval`

with `cron`, you can only pass the day_of_week, hour and minute. For example. `!reschedule cron dao_call_notify wednesday 15 10`

with `date`, you can onlly pass a datetime, which is in the following format, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ssZ` (`1970-01-01 01:02:03+00:00`)

with `interval` you can only pass arguments in the following order; weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds. For example, `!reschedule interval dao_new_cycle_notify 0 0 1 0 0` which translates to `0 weeks, 0 days, 1 hour, 0 minutes, 0 seconds` so that means the notifier will run after 1 hour repeatedly.

> NOTE: The `!reschedule` command can only be used by members of the Effect.AI team.
